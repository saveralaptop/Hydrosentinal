```

### Real-Time Map ✅
```
✅ Firebase onSnapshot listeners (sub-second updates)
✅ Live marker positions synced across all devices
✅ Smooth animation when device location changes
✅ Automatic cleanup on device deletion
```

### Search & Filter ✅

## 🔒 Safety Guarantees

### Location Validation
```typescript
// Before device can be registered:
if (!latitude || !longitude) {
  showError("Please select a location on the map");
  return; // Registration blocked
}
```

### Firestore Security
```javascript
// Rule template (ready to deploy):
match /devices/{deviceId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.ownerId;
}
```

### Real-Time Cleanup
```typescript
// Prevents memory leaks:
const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(...);
useEffect(() => {
  return () => unsubscribe(); // Cleanup on unmount
}, [userId]);
```

---

## 🎯 How to Use

### For End Users
```
1. Click "Add Device" button
2. Enter device name
3. Click on map to select location (OR use "Use Current Location")
4. Zone auto-calculated (Ganga Basin, Drinking Water, etc.)
5. Click "Register Device"
6. Device instantly appears on Live Device Map
7. Click marker to see real-time water quality data
```

### For Developers
```typescript
// Use the live map in any component:
<LiveDeviceMap
  userId={user.uid}
  devices={allDevices}
  latestReadings={readingMap}
  onDeviceSelect={handleMapClick}
  showClustering={true}
  showGeofences={true}
  showHeatmap={true}
/>

// Handle device selection:
const handleMapClick = (deviceId: string) => {
  const device = devices.find(d => d.id === deviceId);
  setSelectedDevice(device);
};
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before deployment, verify:

### Location Selection
- [ ] Register device with map picker
- [ ] "Use Current Location" button works
- [ ] Manual address search works
- [ ] Zone auto-calculated
- [ ] Cannot register without location (validation works)

### Map Display
- [ ] All devices appear at correct coordinates
- [ ] No devices at default/fake locations
- [ ] Marker colors match device status
- [ ] Pulse animation on critical/warning

### Real-Time Sync
- [ ] Create device → appears on map instantly
- [ ] Update device location → marker moves smoothly
- [ ] Delete device → marker removed
- [ ] Battery updates → no page refresh needed

### Interactions
- [ ] Click marker → popup appears
- [ ] Popup shows correct water quality data
- [ ] Search filter works
- [ ] Status filter chips work
- [ ] Zoom clustering activates at zoom < 12

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Firebase Firestore Setup
```
Deploy security rules:
  ✓ Copy from LIVE_DEVICE_MAP_SYSTEM.md
  ✓ Set in Firebase Console
  ✓ Test rules with simulator
```

### 2. Environment Variables
```
Required in .env.local:
  VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECTID=your_project_id
  (Optional) VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_token (using OSM by default)
```

### 3. Build & Deploy
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview  # Local preview
vercel deploy    # Deploy to Vercel (already configured)
```

### 4. Verify in Production
```
✓ Visit /dashboard
✓ Create test device with location
✓ Verify on live map
✓ Check that data syncs in real-time
✓ Test on mobile (responsive)
```

## 📞 Support

### Common Issues & Fixes

**"Devices don't appear on map"**
- Check: Firebase Firestore has devices with non-null latitude/longitude
- Check: User is authenticated (sees only own devices)
- Check: Browser geolocation permission granted

**"Map shows blank/no tiles"**
- Check: Internet connection (OSM Nominatim needs access)
- Check: Browser console for CORS errors
- Fix: Switch to Mapbox if OSM blocked

**"Markers not updating in real-time"**
- Check: Firebase onSnapshot listener active (see console logs)
- Check: Firestore security rules allow read access
- Check: Device location being updated in Firestore

**"Popup data shows old readings"**
- Check: Firestore has latest readings stored
- Check: subscribeToDeviceReadingsForLocation is active
- Fix: Click device again to refresh popup
